Very well done! Nearly a perfect submission. Your implementation is good, your tests are good, your report is fine. I don't have much to say really.

Your errant memory leak may be caused by you not closing your file in the free stream function.

The below code can be shortened:
int transducers_link_sink(transducers_sink s, void *arg,
                          stream *in) {
  // Check that stream in is not in use.
  if (in->open == 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  else {
    in->open = 1;
  }
  s(arg,in->f);

  return 0;
}

Shortened version:
int transducers_link_sink(transducers_sink s, void *arg,
                          stream *in) {
  // Check that stream in is not in use.
  if (in->open) {
    return 1;
  }

  in->open = 1;
  s(arg,in->f);
  return 0;
}

Notice how there's no need to check a boolean for equality to 1 and that the else-block is redundant.

Otherwise very good, keep it up.
